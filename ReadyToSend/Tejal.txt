Dear Professor Tejal,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Aagam Shah, and I am thrilled to be joining UT Dallas as a freshman this coming semester. With a passion for coding cultivated over the past two years, I've embarked on a journey of self-taught Python development, complemented by two internships and various projects.

Currently, I'm delving into the exciting realms of web development. The prospect of combining my coding skills with academic research greatly interests me.

I believe my experiences and enthusiasm align well with potential research assistance opportunities within your team. I have attached my GitHub profile and resume for your perusal.

I'd greatly appreciate the chance to discuss any potential openings or ways I could contribute to your research. If possible, could we schedule a brief meeting? I'm eager to learn more about your ongoing projects and explore avenues for collaboration.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of connecting and learning from your expertise.

PS: I am using my email bot and data entry automation tools to write this email. I scraped your information from https://cs.utdallas.edu/people/faculty/ and then fed the information in a google form. Feel free to explore my work in my GitHub.

Best regards,
Aagam Shah
